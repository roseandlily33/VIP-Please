# Football Project
Group 1 Project - Football website to see stats, scores, and videos about English Football Teams.

## Description:
A non-premiere league english football tracker that shows you your desired favourite team, stores that in a list on localStorage, and dynamically updates the infomation on that screen depending on the team you chose. It uses 2 API's: APIfootball (for the information about the team selected) and the youtube api(to show videos on the team selected).

## Usage:
When the screen loads your presented with a input text box that shows a couple of different teams that you can search for if you don't know which one you want, on submit your taken to the main page, where you can see dynamically added information with a search bar on the side that keeps track of your searches for teams in local storage and displays them on the screen. To search for a new team, simply type in a team on the left hand side search bar and press search. 

## Difficulties:
The difficulties that we faced the most was the actual API's because we needed free ones, there was limited information that we could select from them, including the amount of it, then halfway through the project the API changed the information that it was giving us. For example found a free video API, and could only display one when we wanted 2. We were also trying to display the information for the top players in that team, but the API we were using didn't let us do that so we had to change it to pased games. 

## Problem it solves:
The problem that it solves as being an avid non-premiere league english football watcher that I would like to see results based on the team that I chose. There isn't a whole lot of information about and now with our website you can see everything all in one spot.

## Future Development:
We would like to put in more sections containing things like news about the selected team.
